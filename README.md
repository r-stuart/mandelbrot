# Mandelbrot Generator

A Clojure generator for [Mandelbrot sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

## Usage

Chain together the commands `gen-coords`, `gen-mandels`, `plot-mandels` and `write-to-file` to create the desired Mandelbrot set image.

```
(-> (gen-coords -2 2 -9/8 9/8 1/480)
    (gen-mandels 256 500 8)
    (plot-mandels 1 #(- 255 (* 8 (quot % 16))) #(- 255 (* 16 (mod % 16))) #(- 127 (* 8 (quot % 16))))
    (write-to-file "example-file-name"))
```

This example will produce an image titled "example-file-name.png".
